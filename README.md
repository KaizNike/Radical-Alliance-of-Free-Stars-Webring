# Radical-Alliance-of-Free-Stars-Webring
With the fall of the Yesterweb webring, new rings will rise - this one promotes open expression and nonviolence.

## Joining!
So you've spent too much time as a solitary star upon a lawless sky, let's work on that!

Review our technology of choice [Onion Ring](https://garlic.garden/onionring/). OR wait for our envoys to ready a better treatise. If you know how this website we run on this local planet works, go ahead and submit a issue declaring yourself, or check yourself into the discussion boards.

## Our Rules:
Members are free to be part of worlds with varying cultures, our one rule of cool is that humanity is not to be harmed, physically or mentally. We grant similar fronds to those capable of expression, no matter how small or big. Birds are friends too, do not believe their propaganda.

### What is a Webring?
A series of interlocked websites banded together against the cold dark Search Engine Optimization. They used to be all the rage.
