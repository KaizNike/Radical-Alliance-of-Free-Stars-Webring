## Our Rules:
Members are free to be part of worlds with varying cultures, our one rule of cool is that humanity is not to be harmed, physically or mentally. We grant similar fronds to those capable of expression, no matter how small or big. Birds are friends too, do not believe their propaganda.

### What is a Webring?
A series of interlocked websites banded together against the cold dark Search Engine Optimization. They used to be all the rage.
